🚗 **US Accidents Data Analysis**
📊 **RoadSafe Analytics: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Road Accidents**
📌 **Project Overview**

The US Accidents Data Analysis project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large-scale dataset of road accidents across the United States.
The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accident severity.
By analyzing this real-world dataset, we aim to derive actionable insights that can support road safety awareness, improve infrastructure planning, and guide policy recommendations.

🎯 **Objectives**

Acquire and explore a large, real-world accidents dataset.

Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

Examine accident frequency based on time, location, weather, and road conditions.

Visualize patterns in accident severity using graphs and plots.

Perform hypothesis testing to identify significant relationships.

Present clear insights to help reduce road accidents and improve safety measures.

📂 **Dataset**

Source: US Accidents Dataset (Kaggle)

Size: Over 4 million accident records (2016–present).

Features Include:

Time & Date (start time, end time, etc.)

Location (city, state, latitude, longitude)

Severity Level (accident impact)

Weather Conditions (temperature, visibility, wind speed, etc.)

Road Conditions (traffic signals, junctions, crossings)

🧩 **Project Workflow**
1️⃣ Dataset Acquisition & Exploration

Import data using Pandas.

Perform basic checks (data types, missing values, duplicates).

Gain an overview of accident trends across years.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing or inconsistent values.

Convert date/time columns to proper formats.

Feature engineering (e.g., extracting hour, day, month, season).

Remove irrelevant or redundant columns.

3️⃣ Univariate Analysis

Analyze single variables (e.g., most accident-prone states, time of day, severity distribution).

Visualize using histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.

4️⃣ Bivariate / Multivariate Analysis

Explore relationships between variables:

Weather vs. Severity

Time of Day vs. Accidents

State vs. Accident Frequency

Use heatmaps, scatter plots, and boxplots.

5️⃣ Geospatial Analysis

Plot accident hotspots on a US map.

Identify states/cities with highest accident counts.

6️⃣ Insight Extraction & Hypothesis Testing

Identify key patterns (e.g., Do accidents increase during poor visibility?).

Test hypotheses using statistical methods.

7️⃣ Visualization & Interpretation

Create interactive and static visualizations using:

Matplotlib and Seaborn for plots.

(Optional) Plotly/Folium for geographical insights.

8️⃣ Documentation & Presentation

Prepare a final report with findings, graphs, and recommendations.

Summarize actionable insights for road safety policy makers.

💡 **Key Insights (Expected)**

Peak accident times during rush hours.

Higher accident rates in states with dense traffic or bad weather.

Weather factors (fog, rain, snow) significantly influence accident severity.

Certain road features (junctions, intersections) are high-risk zones.
